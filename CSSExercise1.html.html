    <h1>
        Hokusai Japanese artist
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hokusai was over seventy years old when this famous work of his was made, which means he passed a well known symbolic Japanese age of 61 when the person begins their life again and anew.
        <strong> Philosophical and Spiritual.</strong>
        The Great Wave can be taken as a symbolic image of an important change
        <em>In Japan</em>
        a change which brings the presence of the foreign influences coming from the uncertainty of the sea and opposed to the firmness and stillness of Mount Fuji, the established symbol for the soul of Japan.
