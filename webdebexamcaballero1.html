    <h2>Ancient Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Ancient Japan</em>
        Ancient Japan has made unique contributions to world culture which include the Shinto religion and its architecture, distinctive art objects such
         as haniwa figurines, the oldest pottery vessels in the world, the largest wooden buildings anywhere at their time of construction, and many literary 
         classics including the world's first novel.Although Japan was significantly influenced by China and Korea, the islands were never subject to foreign 
         political control and so were free to select those ideas which appealed to them, adapt them how they wished, and to continue with their indigenous 
         cultural practices to create a unique approach to government, religion, and the arts.

    <h2>Classical Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Classical Japan</em>
        The Heian period (794–1185) is a critical period of Japanese history. Although the cultural heritage imparted by China and the early Korean states remains a part of Japan, distinct and sophisticated Japanese cultural forms emerged during this period. 
        The new capital city was situated in a nation with an estimated population of 5 million people. Heian, by the millennium, had a population of around 100,000, making it larger than any European city of the time but significantly smaller 
        than the Chinese capital of Chang'an or classical Rome.Through most of the period, the powerful Fujiwara family successfully exercised ''marriage politics.'' Rather than make the mistake of actually trying to assume the imperial title, the family 
        would marry their daughters to child emperors, and a Fujiwara male aristocrat would be the de facto head of government.

    <h2>Feudal Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Feudal Japan</em>
        The era of feudal Japan was made up of three main periods: the Kamakura period, Muromachi period, and Azuchi Momoyama period. Each of these periods was ruled by the shogun (military dictator appointed by the emperor) who controlled Japan at the time.
         Feudal Japan lasted from the years 1185 AD to 1603 AD. During this period in Japan’s history, the shoguns held more power in society than the emperor and the imperial court. In the feudal society, the shoguns handed out land to their loyal followers and 
         these estates were then overseen by different stewards and constables. Japan was not the only country to operate under a feudal system, but theirs was different to the feudalism in Europe.

    <h2>Early Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Early Modern Japan</em>
        In the 1550–60 period the Sengoku daimyo, who had survived the wars of the previous 100 years, moved into an even fiercer stage of mutual conflict. These powerful daimyo were harassed not only by each other but also by the rise of common people within their domains. 
        The daimyo sought to resolve their dilemma by acquiring land and people to widen their domains and, finally, by trying to seize control of the whole country. That, of course, required the control of Kyōto, the political centre of Japan since ancient times. 
        Out of these bloody struggles emerged one Sengoku daimyo, Oda Nobunaga of Owari province (in modern Aichi prefecture), who succeeded in occupying the capital as the first feudal unifier.

    <h2>Modern Japan</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Modern Japan</em>
        A Very Short Introduction aims to explode the myths and explore the reality of modern Japan by considering its history, economy, politics, and culture. Japan is arguably today's most successful industrial economy, combining almost unprecedented affluence with 
        social stability and apparent harmony. Japanese goods and cultural products are consumed all over the world, ranging from animated movies and computer games all the way through to cars, semiconductors, and management techniques. In many ways, Japan is an icon 
        of the modern world, and yet it remains something of an enigma to many.
