            <p>How does AI work?
                As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to 
                promote how their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply 
                a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of 
                specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. 
                No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia 
                have features popular with AI developers.In general, AI systems work by ingesting large 
                amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and 
                using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that 
                is fed examples of text can learn to generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image 
                recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples. 
                New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.</p>
